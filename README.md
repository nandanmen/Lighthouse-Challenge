# Lighthouse Labs 21 Day Coding Challenge

This repository contains my solutions to the [21 day coding challenge](https://coding-challenge.lighthouselabs.ca/) hosted by Lighthouse Labs.

Each day has its own folder in the repository (with the exception of some days where the challengers are similar enough that I grouped them together). Each folder contains a `README.md` file that describes the problem and shows my solution. There is also a `solution.js` file that describes the solution and a `solution.test.js` file that contains unit tests for that solution.

## Testing

The testing is done using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). To run the tests, clone the repository and run:

```
$ npm test
```
